# CareerFoundryFinalProject
This repository contains the analysis I performed for my last achievement for my Data Analysis studies. 
## Summary:
FIFA 21 complete player dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-21-completeplayer-dataset/metadata)
Data source: This data is an open-source data from Kaggle. For this project the data can be said
to be external as well and was readily available on Kaggle as public domain. Kaggle is a
reputable and official data source and for that reason I would say that the data is trustworthy.

## Date collection: 
Kaggle is a platform that allows users to find and publish data for exploration
and building models purposes. With that in mind we can say that the data we got from Kaggle
can be considered usage data. The collection method used was web scrapping from the website
https://www.sofifa.com/ using a python script. The fact that the collection process was done by
automation also indicate and could give us a sense of accuracy and reliability that wouldnâ€™t be
necessarily present if the process was done manually. Another significant point to bring about
this data from Kaggle is that it is updated annually which keep the data current hence improving
the reliability and the confidence on the result the data would produce.

## Data content: 
The data contains extensive information about every soccer player in FIFA 21.
The data has 18944 row and 106 columns in total. The 106 columns contain all the players
attributes ranging from names, age, date of birth, height, weight, position on the field,
nationality, clubs they play with, national team affiliation, in which league the play, their value,
their wages, the length and validity of their contract, their skill level, and many more that we
may not necessarily use for the analysis.

## Why I have chosen this data set: 
I am a big fan of soccer, and I have always been interested in getting deeper insight into the
possibilities and answers data can answer regarding soccer. This data set was particularly
interesting because it comes as close as possible to the information we can get in real life about
the players. As a matter of fact, most of the information I will use during my analysis are on part
with the real-life information about the players. Also, I have done an extensive search on Kaggle,
and that data set was the one that checked all the requirements for the project I will be working
on. Coming from Kaggle was also a plus as to the trustworthiness of the data set. The data set is
not only recent, but it can also be updated regularly to reflect any significant changes that could
affect the result of the analysis.
